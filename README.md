# glmdisc

The goal of glmdisc is to discretize continuous features, merge factor levels, and sparsely introduce interactions in logistic regression models.

## Installation

You can install glmdisc from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adimajo/glmdisc", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

For further instructions, go to vignettes > glmdisc.Rmd or go through the vignette directly in RStudio by typing "vignette('glmdisc')" once the package is installed and loaded.
